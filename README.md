Weekend project. I don't have a set schedule. Tough.

# What's in it for me?
- Learn to download text files from the web, convert them into something useful.
- Basic turn-play mechanics, which will be necessary for that killer MMORPG you're working on.
- Networking and IRC protocol.
- My OAuth token if I accidentally paste it on the screen.
- [Go](https://golang.org/) Programming.
- Maybe I'll implement your ~~dumb~~ awesome idea.
- Eventually play the game on Twitch with each other.

# Game Rules
- Everyone gets 10 white cards with answers on them.
- Someone is elected Card Czar for the first round.
- The Card Czar reads the question or fill-in-the-blank phrase on a Black card.
- Everyone else answers using one of their white cards (or 2 for some fill-in-the-blank questions).
- The Card Czar picks the funniest card, whoever submitted it gets one Awesome Point.
- A new player becomes the Card Czar. Repeat.
- You can gamble an Awesome Point and play two cards. Lose, and the winner gets the Awesome Point for the round and the one you gambled. Win and you keep your point plus the one for the round.
- House Rules: You know, every project starts with good intentions. If there's time or if they're easy enough I'll add some house rules.

# Code of Conduct
If I'm ignoring you it's either because I'm busy or you're annoying. If you annoy me (or others) you get to sit outside. Save your twisted mind for the game, this is meant to be fun for everyone.
